# Mobile_App_Dev_Lab1
Created with CodeSandbox

In this lab we primarily became familiar with arrays of objects in React. We were given the Pset of using Array.prototype.map and Array.prototype.filter on a car park database. The map method was used to create a table of all cars, while the filter method was used to create various sorted tables. Each table is an individual component, styled using bootstrap.
